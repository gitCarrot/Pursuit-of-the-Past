        <h2>About the Project</h2>
	<div class="image-container">
            <img src="dark-neko.png" alt="A mysterious and shadowy figure lurking in darkness" class="featured-image">
        </div>
        <p>
            The game concept focuses on navigating through a perilous environment at night, protecting children while evading supernatural monsters. The goal is to reach safety while balancing resources and making strategic decisions to keep the family together.
        </p>

        <h2>Story & Hook</h2>

            <img src="concept1.png" alt="Dark Neko Image 1" class="gallery-image">
            <img src="concept2.jpg" alt="Image 2" class="gallery-image">
            <img src="collect.png" alt="Image 3" class="gallery-image">
        </div>
        <ul>
            <li>The main theme revolves around fear and familial bonds, as players must guide children and manage their emotions.</li>
            <li>The family is pursued by supernatural threats and must overcome the dangers of nighttime exploration.</li>
            <li>Players will face tense and strategic challenges as they find supplies and create escape plans.</li>
        </ul>

        <h2>Updated Game Idea</h2>
        <p>
            The latest version of the game idea refines the world-building and character design while expanding on the mechanics. Here are the key features:
        </p>
        <ul>
            <li><strong>World Building:</strong> Environments include forests and other dangerous landscapes where darkness dominates and light sources are critical.</li>
            <li><strong>Character Design:</strong> Both children and adults have different traits that impact their behavior and interactions.</li>
            <li><strong>Light-Based Mechanics:</strong> Light is central to gameplay and can both help and hinder progress.</li>
            <li><strong>Monsters:</strong> New enemies like "Bracken" and "Coil-Head" present unique patterns that challenge players' ability to recognize and evade.</li>
        </ul>

        <h2>Goals & Obstacles</h2>
<div class="image-container">
            <img src="bright-neko.png" alt="A mysterious and shadowy figure lurking in darkness" class="featured-image">
        </div>
        <ul>
            <li><strong>Primary Goal:</strong> Rescue the children and escape safely while avoiding danger.</li>

            <li><strong>Obstacles:</strong> Unpredictable monsters, resource scarcity, and treacherous terrain create continuous challenges.</li>
        </ul>

        <h2>Monster Mechanics</h2>
        <ul>
		<div class="image-container">
            <img src="monster.png" alt="A mysterious and shadowy figure lurking in darkness" class="featured-image">
            <li><strong>Bracken:</strong> A humanoid figure covered in branches that blends with the environment. It ambushes players who wander too close.</li>
            <li><strong>Coil-Head:</strong> An elongated creature with eerie limbs that hypnotizes players with its gaze. Avoid staring too long!</li>
        </ul>
	 <div class="image-gallery">
            <img src="enemy1.png" alt="Dark Neko Image 1" class="gallery-image">
            <img src="enemy2.png" alt="Image 2" class="gallery-image">
        </div>

        <h2>Suspense & Interaction</h2>
        <ul>
            <li><strong>Suspense:</strong> Finding the right light sources and managing noise will add layers of urgency to the journey.</li>
            <li><strong>Interaction:</strong> Communication with children is essential for their survival but requires careful strategy to avoid detection.</li>
        </ul>

        <h2>Rewards & Replayability</h2>
        <ul>
            <li>Unlock new paths, resources, and narrative elements for completing objectives.</li>
            <li>Replayability is enhanced through various paths and evolving child behaviors.</li>
        </ul>

        <h2>Developing with Unity</h2>
        <p>
            The Unity engine provides dynamic tools like procedural terrain generation and an advanced lighting system, perfect for creating tense and immersive environments. Unity allows us to implement mechanics like strategic exploration, realistic physics, and varied light-based gameplay.
        </p>

        <h2>Conclusion</h2>
        <p>
            This project delivers a survival horror experience centered on family, strategic exploration, and light management. Players will guide their loved ones through nightmarish environments to reach safety while facing terrifying monsters at every turn.
